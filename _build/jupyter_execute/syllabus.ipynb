    "This course approaches topics in calculus through a multidisciplinary lens. It is intended for students who are new to calculus and/or are interested in a contextual application-based approach to calculus. Topics may include summations and quadrature, integration and differentiation related through the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, optimization, and basic differential equations that model natural phenomena. The course will apply a variety of approaches to explore the topics, possibly including historical and creative lenses. Students will gain skills in communicating technical and scientific information, individually and in groups, by explaining mathematical ideas in oral, written, and visual form. The course will utilize technology and mathematical software to compute and explore mathematics. This course is offered every semester and fulfills the second mathematics requirement for the Interdisciplinary Science major. This course does not fulfill the mathematics requirement for the Economics major.\n",
